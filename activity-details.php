          <span class="text-theme-colored1 font-weight-600">Report</span>
          <p>The session began with a round of introductions of all the participants. Mr. Agarwal then dove into
            his experiences as a young start-up founder and why failure is just a stepping stone to success.
            His advice was to fail early and learn from our mistakes and then move onto
            something which plays to our strengths. He then talked about his job experiences in the US and
            why as Indians we should be proud to be a part of a nation that is fundamentally viewed as successful
            and intelligent. Mr. Agarwal then talked about machine learning and artificial intelligence which
            is his area of expertise. The discussion centered around the emerging importance of AI in every sector
            and how we as students and young professionals can adapt ourselves to it. He very helpfully suggested
            a few online courses which we can take up to know more. Mr. Agarwal then encouraged the participants
            to ask him any question related to career development, technology and life abroad.</p>
          <p> <span class="text-theme-colored1 font-weight-600">Impact</span> </p>
          <p>Mr. Agarwal said that the western mentality of extreme individualism is not present in Indians
            and we are always ready to help and support others.The session concluded with a round of thanks to
            Mr. Amit Agarwal for his insight and to all the participants.</p>
